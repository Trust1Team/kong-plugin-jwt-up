# JWT Upstream plugin for Kong
[![][t1t-logo]][Trust1Team-url]

Kong is a scalable, open source API Layer *(also known as an API Gateway, or
API Middleware)*. Kong was originally built at [Mashape][mashape-url] to
secure, manage and extend over [15,000 APIs &
Microservices](http://stackshare.io/mashape/how-mashape-manages-over-15000-apis-and-microservices)
for its API Marketplace, which generates billions of requests per month.

Backed by the battle-tested **NGINX** with a focus on high performance, Kong
was made available as an open-source platform in 2015. Under active
development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations from
startups, to large enterprises and government departments.

The JWT upstream plugin has been developed to provide a JWT towards upstream APIs - registered on Kong - without worrying about the authentication plugin used by a consumer.

## Summary

Only works from Kong 0.8.0.
You can not use the JWT-up plugin in combination with the JWT plugin. This is because the JWT-up by default validates HS256 incoming JWT and implicitly generates a RS256 token for upstream APIs.
The JWT-up can be used in order to have 2 types of consumers:
- consumer applications, using a key-auth policy to reqeust a service
- end-user consumers, using a consumer application, in order to request a service

Both authentication means can be different:
- consumer applications: uses only key-auth
- end-user consumer: uses JWT received after successful login

Both will result - after applying the JWT-up - in a RS256 JWT - enriched - send to upstream API.

## Roadmap

Update to Kong 0.9.0
At the moment we need to provide the certificates hardcodes in the fixtures files. 
This is due to a cert upload issue we have using Kong 0.8.0

## Release Notes v1.4.0
Update JWT time to use ngx.time to be compliant with epoch spec.
