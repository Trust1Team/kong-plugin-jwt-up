# JWT Upstream plugin for Kong
[![][t1t-logo]][Trust1Team-url]

Kong is a scalable, open source API Layer *(also known as an API Gateway, or
API Middleware)*. Kong was originally built at [Mashape][mashape-url] to
secure, manage and extend over [15,000 APIs &
Microservices](http://stackshare.io/mashape/how-mashape-manages-over-15000-apis-and-microservices)
for its API Marketplace, which generates billions of requests per month.

Backed by the battle-tested **NGINX** with a focus on high performance, Kong
was made available as an open-source platform in 2015. Under active
development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations from
startups, to large enterprises and government departments.

The JWT upstream plugin has been developed to provide a JWT towards upstream APIs - registered on Kong - without worrying about the authentication plugin used by a consumer.
